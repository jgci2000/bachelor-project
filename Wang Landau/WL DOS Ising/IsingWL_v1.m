        % Wang-Landau Sampling for the Ising Model (DOS)

        % Defining some constants
% We need to select a starting value of f, the modification factor that it
% is not too large or too small, becuase it will lead to statistical erros
% or a long computation time, respectively. So f0 = e is a safe bet.
f = exp(1);     % Modification factor
n = 2;          % Exponent for the reduction of the modification factor.
L = 2;          % Number of spins for each side of the lattice.
N = L * L;        % Number of spins.
nConfig = 2^N;  % Number of different spin configurations
J = 1;          % Interaction strenght between particles.
% We need to stop the algorithm when all of the states have been visited a
% similar number of times, in other words, when the histogram is flat. As
% it is impossible to obtain a perfectly flat histogram, we check its
% "flatness" when H(E) is not less than p * average(H(E)).
p = 0.95;

% It can be random. We donÂ´t change it during the algorithm.
op = 3;
S = randomSpins(L, op);

        % W-L Algorithm

% For each value of energy there is a number os time visited. To check
% if the energy as already been visited, we must sotre its values.
% We have to discretize the energy domain to get the size of the vectors H
% and g, and the index of each correspondent energy.
% For that, we have to get EMin (all up or all down) and EMax (-EMin). 
SMin = randomSpins(L, 1);
EMin = computeEnergy1(SMin, L, J);
EMax = -EMin;

% The energy is always a multiple of J. So we can create this vector of
% energies.
temp = EMin:4*J:EMax;
E(1) = temp(1);
E(2:length(temp) - 3) = temp(3:end-2);
E(length(temp) - 2) = temp(end);
NE = length(E);

% The density of states (DOS, g(E)) function is unknown at the begining of
% the program. It is our goal to find. The simplest approach to the proble 
% is to consider g(E) = 1.
g = ones(1, NE);
% Because g(E) becomes very large, very soon, we must work with the
% ln(g(E)). So...
lngE = log(g);

% If the modification factor is less than exp(10^(-8)), stop. Else
% continue.
