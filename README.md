# Project

This is my 3rd year Research Project in Monte-Carlo methods in Statistical Mechanics. It means that I use 
Monte-Carlo methods to solve models like the Ising Model, Heisenberg Model, ..., and get the Joint Density
of States.

## Methods

* Wang Landau
* Metropolis
* Random Path Sampling
* Flat Scan Sampling

# Objectives
## Week 1:
* Compile code at the HCP
* Degub the FSS C++ code for large systems (check the histogram)
* Install MATLAB of the ryzen JA
* Run FSS MATLAB code for 3D SC L8 system

## TODO

* Fix the precision error in the FSS SC and MPI code
* Debug Ising Spin S code -> functions working: scan_at_q1, random_config_at_q, WK_rw_criteria; where the problem could be -> scan or rw_step_at_q
* Improve thermodynamics script
* Study the thermodynamics from different lattices
* Learn and study the critical exponents from lattices
* Learn about simd instructions
