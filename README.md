# Project

This is my 3rd year Research Project in Monte-Carlo methods in Statistical Mechanics. It means that I use 
Monte-Carlo methods to solve models like the Ising Model, Heisenberg Model, ..., and get the Joint Density
of States.

## Methods

* Wang Landau
* Metropolis
* Random Path Sampling
* Flat Scan Sampling

## TODO

* Fix the precision error in the FSS SC and MPI code
* Degub Ising Spin S code
* Improve thermodynamics script
* Study the thermodynamics from different lattices
* Learn and study the critical exponents from lattices
* Learn about simd instructions
