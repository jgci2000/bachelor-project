# Project

# TODO

* Report
  * read the remaining references from the Maerzke paper
  * restructure the report
  * what graphs do I need and where do they go? 

* FSS validation
  * validation for L4_SS
  * show that the method converges to the real solution with 1/sqrt(rep)
  * statistical analysis for the resutls extended to L8_SS and L16_SS

* FSS scaling
  * speedup plot
  * fit amdhal's law
  * fit p with 1/plot
  * estimate the S(inf) by amdhal's law and 1/n plot

* Compare FSS to WL
  * Try to implement the version with 1/t and S parameters
  * var/relative error
  * wall time
  * var as a function of 1/sqrt(rep) and 1/sqrt(f_final)
  * compare row steps from each method
  * compare the DOS computed from both methods

* Thermodynamics and FSS
