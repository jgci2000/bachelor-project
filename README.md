# Project

This is my 3rd year Research Project in Monte-Carlo methods in Statistical Mechanics. It means that I use 
Monte-Carlo methods to solve models like the Ising Model, Heisenberg Model, ..., and get the Joint Density
of States.

## Methods

* Wang Landau
* Metropolis
* Random Path Sampling
* Flat Scan Sampling

# Objectives
## Week 1:
* Compile code at the HCP
* Debug the FSS C++ code for large systems (check the histogram)
* Install MATLAB of the ryzen JA
* Run FSS MATLAB code for 3D SC L8 system

## Week 2: 
* Debug the FSS Ising-1/2 code
* Submit a job in the cluster

## Week 5:
* Optimize new FSS Ising-1/2 implementation
* Implement MPI version of my new FSS Ising-1/2 implementation
* Run simulations to validate my implementation
* Make a jupyter notebook for last point


# TODO
## Important


## Secundary
  * Debug Ising Spin S code
* Improve thermodynamics script
* Study the thermodynamics from different lattices
* Learn and study the critical exponents from lattices
