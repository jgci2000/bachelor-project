@article{language_ising,
abstract = {The computer simulation of language change in a finite, structured population which was presented in an earlier paper ('Using Social Impact Theory to simulate language change', Lingua 108, 95-117, 1999), is here extended to speech communities of different sizes. On the basis of the results it is proposed (a) that language change may be faster in small communities; (b) that linguistic borrowing is one sense more likely in small communities; and (c) that the evolution of linguistically marked structures is more likely in small communities. It is argued that these three generalisations could be used to make sense of the different patterns of linguistic diversity observed in the Old and New Worlds, and the distribution of marked word orders in the world's languages. {\textcopyright} 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

@article{buiseness_ising,
abstract = {We propose a stochastic model of interactive formation of individual expectations regarding the business climate in an industry. Our model is motivated by a business climate survey conducted since 1960 in Germany by the Ifo-institute (www.ifo.de). In accordance with the data structure of this survey, in our model there is associated to each economic agent (business manager) a random variable with a three-element state space representing her possible types of expectations. The evolution of individual expectations in a finite population is then modeled as a spatio-temporal stochastic process with local interaction between agents. An appropriate structure of the interaction between agents in our setting turns out to be provided by a Festinger function (in physics called energy function or Hamiltonian) of the Blume-Capel type. Time series of the fractions of agents holding each type of expectations are obtained for the model by Monte Carlo simulations. We find that our model reproduces some generic features of the empirical time series obtained from the German business-climate data, in particular the occurrence of abrupt large but rare swings. in our model, such swings occur as spontaneous phase changes between macroscopic states.

@article{Gutfleisch2011,
abstract = {A new energy paradigm, consisting of greater reliance on renewable energy sources and increased concern for energy efficiency in the total energy lifecycle, has accelerated research into energy-related technologies. Due to their ubiquity, magnetic materials play an important role in improving the efficiency and performance of devices in electric power generation, conditioning, conversion, transportation, and other energy-use sectors of the economy. This review focuses on the state-of-the-art hard and soft magnets and magnetocaloric materials, with an emphasis on their optimization for energy applications. Specifically, the impact of hard magnets on electric motor and transportation technologies, of soft magnetic materials on electricity generation and conversion technologies, and of magnetocaloric materials for refrigeration technologies, are discussed. The synthesis, characterization, and property evaluation of the materials, with an emphasis on structure-property relationships, are discussed in the context of their respective markets, as well as their potential impact on energy efficiency. Finally, considering future bottlenecks in raw materials, options for the recycling of rare-earth intermetallics for hard magnets will be discussed. A new energy paradigm, consisting of greater reliance on renewable energy sources and increased concern for energy efficiency, has accelerated research in energy-related technologies. Magnetic materials play an important role in improving the efficiency and performance of many devices.

@article{Pelissetto2002,
abstract = {We review results concerning the critical behavior of spin systems at equilibrium. We consider the Ising and the general O(N)-symmetric universality classes, including the N → 0 limit that describes the critical behavior of self-avoiding walks. For each of them, we review the estimates of the critical exponents, of the equation of state, of several amplitude ratios, and of the two-point function of the order parameter. We report results in three and two dimensions. We discuss the crossover phenomena that are observed in this class of systems. In particular, we review the field-theoretical and numerical studies of systems with medium-range interactions. Moreover, we consider several examples of magnetic and structural phase transitions, which are described by more complex Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson Hamiltonians, such as N-component systems with cubic anisotropy, O(N)-symmetric systems in the presence of quenched disorder, frustrated spin systems with noncollinear or canted order, and finally, a class of systems described by the tetragonal Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson Hamiltonian with three quartic couplings. The results for the tetragonal Hamiltonian are original, in particular we present the six-loop perturbative series for the $\beta$-functions. Finally, we consider a Hamiltonian with symmetry O(n1) ⊕ O(n2) that is relevant for the description of multicritical phenomena. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},
