abstract = {We describe a Monte Carlo algorithm for doing simulations in classical statistical physics in a different way. Instead of sampling the probability distribution at a fixed temperature, a random walk is performed in energy space to extract an estimate for the density of states. The probability can be computed at any temperature by weighting the density of states by the appropriate Boltzmann factor. Thermodynamic properties can be determined from suitable derivatives of the partition function and, unlike "standard" methods, the free energy and entropy can also be computed directly. To demonstrate the simplicity and power of the algorithm, we apply it to models exhibiting first-order or second-order phase transitions. &copy;2004 American Association of Physics Teachers.},

@article{Amaral2014,
abstract = {We explore the thermodynamics of the 2-D Ising model from a random path sampling method. We show how convergence of free energy and magnetization is obtained in a number of sweeps orders of magnitude below the number of total configurations. The effects of external parameters, such as magnetic field (H) and temperature (T) are accounted in a computationally simple way, allowing very detailed (H, T)-dependent calculations. The effects of more complex interactions can also be considered, particularly magnetovolume coupling, which has proven to be difficult to tackle using traditional approaches. We show its effect on magnetic entropy change (magnetocaloric effect) in this microscopic scenario. As magnetic refrigeration technology matures, the microscopic optimization of magnetovolume effects to enhance the magnetocaloric properties may become a valuable tool in the search of new magnetic refrigerants.},

@article{Korotana2016,
abstract = {Manganites with the formula La1-xCaxMnO3 for 0.2 < x < 0.5 undergo a magnetic field driven transition from a paramagnetic to ferromagnetic state, which is accompanied by changes in the lattice and electronic structure. An isotropic expansion of the La0.75Ca0.25MnO3 cell at the phase transition has been observed experimentally. It is expected that there will be a large entropy change at the transition due to its first order nature. Doped lanthanum manganite (LMO) is therefore of interest as the active component in a magnetocaloric cooling device. However, the maximum obtained value for the entropy change in Ca-doped manganites merely reaches a moderate value in the field of a permanent magnet. The present theoretical work aims to shed light on this discrepancy. A combination of finite temperature statistical mechanics and first principles theory is applied to determine individual contributions to the total entropy change of the system by treating the electronic, lattice and magnetic components independently. Hybrid-exchange density functional (B3LYP) calculations and Monte Carlo simulations are performed for La0.75Ca0.25MnO3. Through the analysis of individual entropy contributions, it is found that the electronic and lattice entropy changes oppose the magnetic entropy change. The results highlighted in the present work demonstrate how the electronic and vibrational entropy contributions can have a deleterious effect on the total entropy change and thus the potential cooling power of doped LMO in a magnetocaloric device.},

abstract = {A method is presented to improve the speed of convergence of Wang-Landau simulations as used to calculate the density of states of continuous systems. The density of states is first crudely estimated with calculations employing a smoothed potential-energy surface. This estimate is then used as a seed for subsequent Wang-Landau simulations using the original potential. The performance of the method is demonstrated by employing several simple models, including an analytically solvable harmonic system as well as a G model of a protein. For all systems considered, the seeded simulations were found to converge significantly faster and with higher accuracy than the standard Wang-Landau simulations. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Institute of Physics.},
